If you prefer to test using a wallet, follow instructions below.

# Wallet Setup
## Host / Endpoint
You should use a Telos host/endpoint near you. Some good choices would be: 
- test.telos.kitchen, port 443, https, USA East
- test.telos.caleos.io, port 443, https, USA West
- ...hypha.earth, port 443, https, Europe West
- ...
- ...

## Desktop / Laptop
Scatter (https://get-scatter.com) or SQRL (https://sqrlwallet.io) are best on desktop/laptop. 

> Is the Telos Testnet a default network on Scatter?  It is on SQRL, so we may want to recommend SQRL to new testers because it eliminates the need for network setup.
